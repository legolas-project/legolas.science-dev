Below is a collection of examples, showing a couple of the things that Legolas can do. These are taken from our method
paper, and are explained in more detail there.

# Suydam cluster modes

Single spectrum with eigenfunctions, showing Suydam cluster modes in a cylindrical geometry with shear flow.

# Quasi-modes

![image-center]({%link /assets/images/example_quasimodes.png %}){: .align-center}
Single spectrum with eigenfunctions, shows a resistive quasi-mode and its theoretical prediction.


# Resistive tearing modes
![image-center]({% link /assets/images/example_tearing.png %}){: .align-center}
Both single and multiruns of a resistive tearing equilibrium, showing perfect agreement with theoretical predictions.
Legolas can handle magnetic Reynolds numbers of a few million without any issues.
