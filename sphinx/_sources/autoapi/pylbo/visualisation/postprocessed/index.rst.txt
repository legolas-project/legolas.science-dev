   pylbo.visualisation.postprocessed.PostprocessedHandler




.. py:class:: PostprocessedHandler(data, pp_ax)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pylbo.visualisation.eigenfunction_interface.EigenfunctionInterface`

   Main handler for post-processed quantities.

   .. py:method:: _check_data_is_present(self)

      Checks if the required data is present to draw for example
      eigenfunctions, is overloaded in subclasses.

   .. py:method:: update_plot(self)

      Updates the plot when an event is triggered, clears and then redraws
      the functions. Rescaling of the axes is done automatically.
      Has to be overridden in a subclass.

   .. py:method:: _get_title(self, pp_name)

      Creates the title of the post-processed quantity plot.
      LaTeX formatting is used and numbers are replaced with the
      corresponding suffix: :math:`(1, 2, 3)`
      becomes :math:`(x, y, z)` or :math:`(r, \theta, z)`.

      :param pp_name: The name of the post-processed quantity as present in the datfile.
      :type pp_name: str

      :returns: **name** -- The 'new' name for the post-processed quantity, used as title.
      :rtype: str

   .. py:method:: _mark_points_without_data_written(self)

      For dataseries, it is possible that not all datasets in the series
      have eigenfunctions associated with them. This routine will toggle a change
      in the opacity value for datapoints with no functions, so they are
      clearly distinguishable from those who do have them.
