**What's new:**
Complete overhaul of the Pylbo framework, with lots of new features.
- Eigenfunction plotting on both single and multi spectrum plots
- Multiple datasets can be merged into one figure
- Improved continua calculations (non-adiabatic slow continua) which can be added to most figuretypes
- Direct comparison of two datasets on the same figure, with interactive eigenfunctions
- Regression tests have been reworked: with lots of duplicate code removed and multirun tests have been added
